# Hack-2023


# Game design Ideas:
* button that can be pressed by you or enemies
* button that can be pressed by tetris blocks
* Buttons can block you in tetris mode, or open doors or anything like that
* Some levels will already have tetris blocks, so you need to place 5 in a row to delete
* some tetris blocks can be hit and give you power ups
* tetris speeds up as you go on in levels


## power ups:
* Slow down tetris
